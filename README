Send IPsec traffic to another machine where it gets processed.
There the IPsec implementation has to deliver it to the local stack
or forward it after decryption.  By reflecting the packets, the way
back is also tested.  When the response is received at the generating
machine, the test is considered successful.

Currently ICMP ping and UDP packets are encrypted with ESP.  Transport
and tunnel mode are tested with all combinations of IPv4 and IPv6.

Tests for AH/IPCOMP/IPIP with TCP and path MTU discovery are planned.
